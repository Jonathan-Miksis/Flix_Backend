Have created most of the backend - need to look at associations again and see why things aren't saving the the database
  Connect reviews, media, users, and comments together so that they become associated

ABSOLUTELY NEED TO FIGURE OUT APIS - need to combine them so data in database is full for media 

Need show action for all movies to search by different things

THIS WOULD COMPLETE THE MVP FOR BACKEND MOVE ONTO THE FRONT END

BACKEND

Need to aggregate flix ratings into each movie and display as part of the movie data

Still need to get full cast, trailer info, img, as well as fix director information 

Need to reseed database afterward with updated information 

Make sure appropriate serializers are in place to get data displayed correctly

THIS should finish backend

FRONTEND

Need to then create frontend for creating comments 

linking created reviews to specific movies DONE

Need to do a media show action and search 

edit actions for comments & reviews
